## About Me
I have a rich background in software engineering with over thirteen years of experience solving complex issues and delivering robust solutions. My journey has taken me through various exciting roles, most recently as a Solutions Engineer at Algolia, where I demonstrated my expertise in AI solutions and SaaS products.

## Bootcamp Experience
In my quest for continuous learning and innovation, I recently completed a rigorous nine-week Data Science and AI bootcamp at Le Wagon. During this bootcamp, I led a capstone project where I developed a web application that converts user prompts into a 2D platform video game. This project utilized BERT for word vectorization and VGG19 for style transfer, showcasing my ability to apply advanced AI techniques creatively.
